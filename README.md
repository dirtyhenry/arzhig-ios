Arzhig iOS is an app I am developing for my toddlers.

Some requirements to install the project:

## Features

### Screen Time

Of course, **screen time for kids should be minimal**.

Butâ€¦

- it can be beneficial when a parent is nearby;
- existing options are not good alternatives for kids;
- using offline stored videos is better for the planet than streamingly the same videos over and over again.
